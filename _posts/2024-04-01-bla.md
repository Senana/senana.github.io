## Musings on words

I take issue with the word "servant leader". Just the word, not necessarily the concept. Although I have to admit, I don't really know what that concept is supposed to mean. I hear the term thrown around, and it did not make sense to me, so I looked it up before ranting about it. That did not help. I am slightly more disoriented now. Let me explain. 

When we use words, we usually reference. Unless they are direct expressions of affect - like "Dang it!" - words help conjure up an image as similar as possible to our own in the minds of others. That applies to descriptions, but it's not not true for imperatives. "Go", as we all know when dealing with pets, requires a related inner image of the action implied. Declarations, in the sense of acts of meaning to a system, require even stronger references. "I declare you king" only relates to the intended meaning in a complicated, specific set of circumstances. You can only "declare" your taxes in a tightly controlled frame of reference. 

This is easy, in the case of words like "chair" or "ear". Less so when it comes to more complex terms, like, well, "servant" or "leader". The types of situations you need to experience to make sense of them are quite large. You need to know a whole set of behaviours ...
